# React NHL Statistic Dashboard

This goal of this project is to grab some of the data from the National Hockey League API (https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/) and display it in various graphs and charts. The point of this is mainly to get some experience with React in a fun and interesting way.

## Status 2021-03-21
This project is still in it's early stages so it is obviously doesn't show much. Currently it just spits out some of the data from the NHL API and displays a default chart from react-charts. Hopefully I can flesh it out in the coming weeks!
